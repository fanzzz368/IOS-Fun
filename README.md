## Notes

One challenge I faced was connecting GitHub with XCode. I first started the project on XCode, and I had to do some research when I wanted to transport the code to GitHub. In the end, I created an empty repository, and then I went through the terminal and entered the folder where my project is located, and did git remote add origin <repository-url> that links the remote repository with the local repository.
